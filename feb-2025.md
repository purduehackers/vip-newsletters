# VIP Newsletter 4

Dear friends,

[In November](https://blog.purduehackers.com/vip-newsletter/the-highest-peaks-yet), I wrote about feeling continually surprised by Purdue Hackers‚Äô growing scale and quality. These ever-growing peaks have been the result of a fast-growing number of community members who have begun to care deeply about Purdue Hackers & put their souls into it.

When I began running Purdue Hackers in 2022, I felt like I was carrying a torch alone, dreaming of the day that Purdue Hackers would no longer be downstream of me. Today‚Äôs update represents that dream becoming reality: our gallery exhibition‚Äìflavored demo day, new harder-than-they-sound demo sessions at Hack Night, and month-long commit challenge, happened only because so many people‚Äîwho are not me‚Äîmade them happen.

_This is the_ [_Purdue Hackers_](https://purduehackers.com) _VIP Newsletter._ [_Read the previous edition here._](https://blog.purduehackers.com/vip-newsletter/the-highest-peaks-yet) _If you‚Äôd rather not receive these,_ [_unsubscribe here_](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSff6JvHc7istmPqk63lkCHtqOlkoQR8bxjn-rj_aKsEXlvMRg/viewform)_._

## BURST ‚ú∑

On December 8th, 2024, we ran a 4-hour pop-up gallery exhibition called **BURST ‚ú∑**, featuring 9 projects built at Hack Night over the past year.

Over 200 people stopped by (including the [Dean of the College of Science](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucy-flesch-7b8799301_burst-student-made-creative-technical-activity-7275147902383976449-q8ru)), grabbed [a badge](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/the-best-badge) and a drink at our (non-alcoholic) bar, and walked through an exhibition of hacker-made works.

Some of the featured projects:

* [The Sign](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/sign), a meter-tall Conway glider which tells the time via colors
* [keymashed](https://github.com/kartva/keymashed), a Rust app that throttles the network on your computer unless you mash your keyboard
* [ETea](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3085040/ETea/), a video game about an alien bobarista far from home
* NFC-enabled [Republic of Hackerland Passports](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/papers-please)

BURST ‚ú∑ was the first iteration of our Show, a yearly demo day which takes a different form, surfacing different constraints, every time it runs. The 2025 Show will be something entirely different.

There was something so magical about reimagining these scrappy technical projects, which were never intended to be art, as serious art pieces for an exhibition in an actual gallery. One of my favorite installations was the Sign, which we paired with the current [Lightning Time](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time) rear-projected onto frosted acrylic hanging from the ceiling:

I‚Äôm so proud of this event & grateful for the dozens of students who helped set it up, as well as [Purdue Galleries](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/rueffschool/galleries/) for allowing us to use one of their galleries.

## üèÅ How we cracked demos

Hack Night, the mini-hackathon we run every Friday night, has been running for 2 and a half years.

We‚Äôve had an amazing start to Spring 2025 with three Hack Nights, each drawing over 90 attendees. Beyond all the making, breaking, and collaborating, we continued our tradition of hosting [Republic of Hackerland passport](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/papers-please) ceremonies during Hack Night 5.14. Some of our members have been developing a multiplayer mixed-reality version of [Laser Tag](https://anagly.ph), allowing them to completely transform the Bechtel Design and Innovation Center into an arena with the press of a button. It was incredible to see it come to life!

Additionally, sessions are officially making a comeback‚Äîand we couldn‚Äôt be more excited! They are one-off events at Hack Night that run at 10pm, covering everything from workshops to lightning talks. It‚Äôs been incredible to see how much demand there is, with so many people eager to lead them that we‚Äôre scheduling far in advance to avoid overlap. Recent sessions have featured iOS Tweak Development, an Intro to Quantum Computing, and an update on the Rubik‚Äôs cube computer [Qter](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/qter/tree/main)!

Thank you to [Quantum Research Sciences](https://quantumresearchsciences.com), a local company building software for quantum computers, for sponsoring Hack Night 5.15 and running a session! üñ§

**üü© Commit Overflow**

Over winter break, we launched **Commit Overflow**‚Äîour annual challenge to keep the momentum going and make meaningful progress on creative technical projects. The rules were simple: contribute to a project, share an update of your progress, and keep the streak alive. Anyone who hit 10 or more total days earned a personalized laser-cut badge, engraved with their name and the number of days they contributed.¬†

**From December 17th through January 12th, 43 participants shared a total of 633 commits, with 13 people posting updates** _**every single day**_ **for 26 days straight!**

**üö¢ Featured Ships**

*   [**Lasertag**](https://anagly.ph)**:** a multiplayer mixed-reality FPS by [@anaglyphs](https://github.com/anaglyphs) that turns any space into a laser tag arena with a few Meta Quests and the press of a button.
    
*   [Gradescope to iCalendar](https://gradescope.thomasqm.com): a TypeScript app by [@canislupaster](https://github.com/canislupaster) that converts Gradescope deadlines to an iCalendar feed via a subscription to the .ics URL.

**üì£ Our Asks**

* **If you‚Äôre an alum or individual:** Please consider covering pizza for our next Hack Night. Food is our largest expense & covering it allows us to fund more student projects. We spend $200 per Hack Night, but anything helps. [Donate here](https://hcb.hackclub.com/donations/start/purdue-hackers)!
    
* **If you represent a company:** We would love to run an event with you this semester, e.g. career building or tech talk, as well as get you in front of our students at the Spring 2025 Show. Please reach out if you‚Äôre interested!¬†
    
* **If you‚Äôre Purdue faculty:** Please consider spreading the word about Purdue Hackers to your students. You can view all upcoming Hack Nights and workshops on our [events site](https://events.purduehackers.com).

For everyone: please reply to this email with feedback on this newsletter. I want this to be something you continue to be excited to read every month, and I welcome your suggestions for how we can make it better.

With üíõ,
Matthew
