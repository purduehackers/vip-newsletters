# VIP Newsletter 4

Dear friends,

[In November](https://blog.purduehackers.com/vip-newsletter/the-highest-peaks-yet), I wrote about feeling continually surprised by Purdue Hackers‚Äô growing scale and quality. These ever-growing peaks have been the result of a fast-growing number of community members who care deeply about Purdue Hackers & put their souls into it.

When I began running Purdue Hackers in 2022, I felt like I was carrying a torch alone, dreaming of the day that Purdue Hackers would no longer be downstream of me. Today‚Äôs update represents that dream becoming reality: our demo day in an art gallery, new build-in-public check-in sessions at Hack Night, and month-long commit challenge, happened only because so many people‚Äîwho are not me‚Äîmade them happen.

## BURST ‚ú∑

On December 8th, 2024, we ran a 4-hour pop-up gallery exhibition called **BURST ‚ú∑**, featuring 9 projects built at Hack Night over the past year.

Over 200 people stopped by (including the [Dean of the College of Science](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucy-flesch-7b8799301_burst-student-made-creative-technical-activity-7275147902383976449-q8ru)), grabbed [a badge](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/the-best-badge) and a drink at our (non-alcoholic) bar, and walked through an exhibition of hacker-made creative technical projects.

Some of the featured projects:

* [The Sign](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/sign), a meter-tall Conway glider which tells the time via colors
* [keymashed](https://github.com/kartva/keymashed), a Rust app that throttles the network on your computer unless you mash your keyboard
* [ETea](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3085040/ETea/), a video game about an alien bobarista far from home
* NFC-enabled [Republic of Hackerland Passports](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/papers-please)

There was something so magical about reimagining these scrappy technical projects, which were never intended to be art, as serious art pieces for an exhibition in an actual gallery. One of my favorite installations was the Sign, which we paired with the current [Lightning Time](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time) rear-projected onto frosted acrylic hanging from the ceiling:

I‚Äôm so proud of this event & grateful for the dozens of students who helped set it up, as well as [Purdue Galleries](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/rueffschool/galleries/) for allowing us to use one of their galleries.

BURST ‚ú∑ was the first iteration of the Show, a yearly demo day which takes a different name, brand, and form every time it runs. The 2024 Show was a gallery exhibition; the 2025 Show will be entirely different. BURST ‚ú∑ was an incredible start to a yearly challenge to surface our work in fresh & creative ways, surfacing different constraints every time. I'm so excited to see what the community will do next year.

## üèÅ How we cracked demos

For the past 6 months, Hack Night, our weekly mini-hackathon, has included a midnight demo session called **?Checkpoints**. We've mentioned it in the previous two editions ([#1](https://blog.purduehackers.com/vip-newsletter/the-highest-peaks-yet), [#2](https://blog.purduehackers.com/vip-newsletter/the-plan-is-in-motion)), but the last couple months have proven it to be a resounding success. Dozens of people build in public & share what they're working on every week. It's what was missing from Hack Night.

Nearly every project featured at BURST ‚ú∑ was shared as it was being built by its creator at Checkpoints. Checkpoints and BURST ‚ú∑ reinforced each other for project creators: BURST ‚ú∑ was a milestone to look forward to, and Checkpoints were energizing playtesting sessions.

You'd think a hackathon-flavored event like Hack Night would have been runnning demo sessions since its inception‚Äîbut it took us two years and three and a half tries to finally run Checkpoints. Creating an environment that encourages building in public and sharing scrappy works-in-progress was challenging: many folks associate demo sessions with finished & polished projects, and undoing that expectation was an uphill battle.

The story of how we succeeded goes back 2 years, and it's also the story of how Hack Night came to look the way it does‚Äîwith 80 folks hacking through the night, surrounded by friends, [LED signs](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/sign), [passports](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/papers-please), and [laser-cut collectibles](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/the-best-badge).

## üü© Commit Overflow

Over winter break, we challenged our community to make meaningful progress on a technical project every day. **Commit Overflow** [has been running since 2022](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/commit-overflow-2023), but this year's was the best yet.

The rules were simple: every day, contribute to a project and share an update of your progress in our Discord server. If you share 10 or more updates, we'll laser cut a badge with your name on it. If you share an update every day for all 26 days of the challenge, you'll get a second badge.

[picture of the badges]

From December 17th to January 12th, 43 community members shared 633 commits; 13 of them shared an update every day for 26 days straight. Some of my favorite projects include a toy cloud, creative iOS modding, laser tag in VR, a conlang, and a Rubik's Cube computer.

Commit Overflow was the source of so much energy in the community over winter break. One of my favorite things
